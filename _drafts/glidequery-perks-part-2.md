Another problem I mentioned in [Part 0](/2023/01/30/glidequery-perks-part-0.html) of this series is that GlideRecord is squirrelly when it comes to precedence of logical <abbr>AND</abbr> and <abbr>OR</abbr>. GlideQuery avoids this issue by disallowing ambiguous boolean logic.

## Mind your <abbr>AND</abbr>s and <abbr>OR</abbr>s
