<span class="lead">One of the problems I never knew GlideRecord has</span> is there's only a couple ways to get records out of itâ€”either `get()` for a single record or `query()` and `next()` for multiple records. GlideQuery breaks the mold by offering a gaggle of expressive new ways to loop through the resulting records.

This article offers a high level overview and a few samples of the kinds of things you can do with GlideQuery, but alongside this article I'm also publishing a new resource I call GlideQuery Design Patterns. More on that at the end of the article.

## GlideQuery, Stream, and Optional


## Working with Streams


## Working with Optionals







## Outline for this article

Stream processing (after select)
 - forEach
 - map, filter, reduce (GQ script include deserves a mention)
 - every, some
 - flatMap, chunk
 - find
 - toArray (mention this only briefly)

Optional processing (after selectOne, get, or getBy)
 - ifPresent
 - isEmpty
 - isPresent
 - orElse
 - get
 - filter, map, flatMap (mention these only briefly)

(I have my suspicions about why Optional doesn't have an `ifEmpty` method. I think it could lead to anti-patterns and/or its just plan not useful to be down inside a function with no data to work with. Why would you want to be stuck down inside a function for no reason??)

The one thing GlideQuery is just straight-up missing is the ability to interact with journal fields.
