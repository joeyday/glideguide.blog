Before I start my GlideQuery series proper, I'd be remiss if I didn't take two steps back and recognize all the great content already out there on the topic. I certainly didn't discover all the benefits of GlideQuery myself, though I do have direct experience with most of them. This article will be a complete rundown on every publicly available resource I can find.

Mind you, I'm not presenting any of the following as pre-requisites to my series. I won't assume you've engaged with any of this material beforehand. But likewise, I'll do my best not to just regurgitate what others have said. Though of necessity I'll be covering the same material, wherever possible I'll try to give it my own unique spin and share my own original code examples.

So feel free to engage with as much or as little of this content as you like up front, or ignore it for now and explore it later if the rest of my series piques your interest.

## Original content by Peter Bell

If you have access to it, Peter Bell's original Knowledge 2020 session is a great introduction to GlideQuery and all of its benefits over GlideRecord. I think you need to have been registered for Knowledge2020 in order to access it, but it was free (it was the first year they did a 100% online conference).
