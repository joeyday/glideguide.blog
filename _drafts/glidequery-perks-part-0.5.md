Before I start my GlideQuery series proper, I'd be remiss if I didn't take two steps back and recognize all the great content already out there on the topic. I certainly didn't discover all the benefits of GlideQuery myself, though I do have direct experience with most of them. This article will be a complete rundown on every publicly available resource I can find.

Mind you, I'm not presenting any of the following as pre-requisites to my series. I won't assume you've engaged with any of this material beforehand. But likewise, I'll do my best not to just regurgitate what others have said. Though of necessity I'll be covering the same material, wherever possible I'll try to give it my own unique spin and share my own original usage examples.

So feel free to engage with as much or as little of this content as you like up front, or ignore it for now and explore it later if the rest of my series piques your interest.

## Content featuring Peter Bell

Peter Bell is the guy within ServiceNow who created GlideQuery as a side project to help him with his normal day job as a senior engineer on the IT Asset Management team. Naturally, his own content is a great introduction to the API.

Bell's original CreatorCon 2020 breakout session, _[GlideQuery: A modern upgrade to GlideRecord (CCB3052)](https://www.servicenow.com/community/creatorcon-blogs/glidequery-a-modern-upgrade-to-gliderecord/ba-p/2331050)_, is, as far as I know, the first time GlideQuery was mentioned officially to the public. Its a great introduction to the API and all of its benefits over GlideRecord (and here's the accompanying [slide deck](/files/2023-02-01-ccb3052-bell-glidequery.pdf)).
