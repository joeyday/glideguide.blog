GlideGuide is lovingly handcrafted using the (Jekyll)[https://jekyllrb.com/] static site generator and hosted on (GitHub Pages)[https://pages.github.com/].

Text on the site is presented in the open source typefaces (Source Sans Pro)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Sans] and (Source Code Pro)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Pro] created by Paul D. Hunt and released by Adobe in 2012. The web versions are used here courtesy of (Adobe Fonts Pro)[https://fonts.adobe.com/].
